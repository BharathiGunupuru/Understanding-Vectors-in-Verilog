# Understanding-Vectors-in-Verilog
This project demonstrates the use of vectors in Verilog, including their declaration, manipulation, and application. It features a circuit with a 3-bit input that outputs the same vector and splits it into three 1-bit outputs. Each output corresponds to a specific bit of the input vector (o0 = bit 0, o1 = bit 1, o2 = bit 2).
